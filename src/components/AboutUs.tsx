      <h1> History</h1>
      <p>
        Founded amidst the vibrant culture and warm hospitality of the
        Philippines, the Christ Centered Community, affectionately known as CCC,
        has been a cornerstone of faith and community in its bustling urban
        setting. Originating in the early 20th century, CCC began as a humble
        gathering of believers seeking spiritual solace and kinship in the midst
        of life's challenges. Over the years, it grew into a thriving center of
        worship and service, welcoming individuals from all walks of life into
        its fold. Through times of joy and adversity, CCC has remained a
        steadfast source of support, extending a hand of compassion to those in
        need and spreading the message of Christ's love throughout the
        archipelago. Today, as a testament to its enduring legacy, CCC continues
        to shine brightly as a beacon of hope and unity in the heart of the
        Philippines, embodying the spirit of Christ-centered living for
        generations to come.
